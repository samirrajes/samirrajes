### Hi! I am a Creative Technologist.

I build interactive systems across Unreal, Unity, TouchDesigner, and physical computing, blending real-time graphics, machine learning, and custom hardware. My work ranges from developing and training ML models from scratch, to modelling emergent social simulations in Unreal Engine, to designing and engineering kinetic installations and experimental audio electronics.
